## Overview

The Blockchain ICO Dapp is designed to streamline the process of participating in our ICO and managing user accounts securely through blockchain technology. 
It accommodates various user roles and actions, ensuring a seamless experience for both new and existing buyers.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can log into their accounts on our website using their blockchain wallet, preferably Metamask
- **White-listed Buyers:** Users who participated in previous projects and are white-listed can access exclusive features.
- **New Buyers:** Users who are new to our platform can register, purchase tokens, and participate in the ICO.
- **Token Burning:** Users have the option to burn their tokens, removing them from circulation.

## Getting Started  //If your not a developer start from step 2.

To get started with the Bitcoin 2.0 ICO, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

In your terminal if using windows clone the repo below.

git clone https://github.com/Uniq23/CrowdsaleAppCapstone.git

2. Once you get to our website click the CONNECT WALLET button.

3. Login to your Metamask wallet.
  
4. If you are a previous buyer or part of any of our other projects you would be considered whitelisted and will recieve an additional 25% of all tokens purchased.
   this is verified by your Metamask wallet address. 'Click BUY TOKENS'

5. After purchasing your tokens you will see the loading symbol on your screen and you will be receiving your transaction receipt as well as your tokens in your Metamask wallet.

6. If you already own your tokens and would like to burn them instead 'click BURN TOKENS'
   This will decrease the total supply of the tokens and increase the price of the tokens left in circulation.


## Usage/use case

The use case for the all-new Bitcoin 2.0 token crowdsale revolves around leveraging the principles of blockchain technology to enhance the functionalities of the original 
Bitcoin network while addressing some of its limitations. The goal is to provide a more efficient, scalable, and feature-rich platform that can cater to a broader range 
of use cases beyond just being a store of value.

Key use cases for the Bitcoin 2.0 token crowdsale include:

Enhanced Scalability: Bitcoin 2.0 aims to address the scalability challenges faced by the original Bitcoin network by implementing advanced consensus mechanisms and layer 2 solutions. 
This enables faster transaction processing and lowers fees, making microtransactions and day-to-day usage feasible.

Smart Contracts: Bitcoin 2.0 introduces a robust smart contract platform that allows developers to create and deploy programmable contracts. This opens up a wide range of possibilities, 
such as decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and more.

Interoperability: Bitcoin 2.0 aims to be more interoperable with other blockchain networks and protocols, enabling seamless value transfer and data exchange across different platforms. 
This could lead to cross-chain DeFi solutions, token swaps, and improved global interoperability.

Privacy and Security: Privacy features, such as zero-knowledge proofs and confidential transactions, enhance the privacy of transactions on the Bitcoin 2.0 network. This ensures that 
sensitive financial and personal information remains secure while still being publicly auditable.

Decentralized Identity: Bitcoin 2.0 could enable decentralized identity solutions, allowing users to have greater control over their personal information and reducing the risk of data breaches.

Tokenization of Assets: The Bitcoin 2.0 network could facilitate the tokenization of real-world assets, such as real estate, stocks, and commodities. This would enable fractional 
ownership and improve liquidity in traditionally illiquid markets.

Governance Mechanisms: Bitcoin 2.0 could implement more decentralized and transparent governance mechanisms that empower token holders to participate in decision-making processes 
related to network upgrades, parameter changes, and more.

Crowdfunding and ICOs: The Bitcoin 2.0 platform could offer a more secure and efficient environment for hosting crowdfunding campaigns and initial coin offerings (ICOs). 
This would provide projects with a reliable fundraising method and investors with increased transparency.

Global Remittances: With improved transaction speed and lower fees, Bitcoin 2.0 could become a preferred method for cross-border remittances, especially in regions with 
limited access to traditional banking services.

Micropayments and Content Monetization: Bitcoin 2.0's scalability improvements could make micropayments viable, allowing content creators to monetize their work on a small scale, 
encouraging innovation and creativity.

The Bitcoin 2.0 token crowdsale aims to position itself as a cutting-edge blockchain network that builds upon the legacy of the original Bitcoin while incorporating innovative 
features that enable a wide range of use cases and drive mainstream adoption of blockchain technology.
